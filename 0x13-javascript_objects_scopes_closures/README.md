# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

![JavaScript](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png)

## Description

This repository contains a series of JavaScript exercises focused on understanding objects, scopes, and closures. Each task is designed to help you grasp fundamental concepts of JavaScript programming, from creating objects to working with different scopes and closures. By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript's versatility and power.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The significance of JavaScript programming
- How to create objects in JavaScript
- The concept of `this` and what it refers to
- The meaning of `undefined` in JavaScript
- The importance of variable types and scopes
- The concept of a closure and how it works
- What a prototype is and its role in JavaScript
- How to inherit properties and methods from one object to another

## Requirements

- All exercises should be implemented in JavaScript.
- Use the provided template files for each task.
- Use a compatible text editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
- All your files must be executable.
- The first line of all your JavaScript files should be `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- Your code should be semistandard compliant.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific task directory you want to work on (e.g., `0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures`).
3. Edit the template JavaScript files to implement the required functionality for each task.
4. Run the script using the Node.js interpreter (e.g., `node 0-main.js`) to test your implementation.

## List of Tasks

1. **Rectangle #0**: Define an empty class `Rectangle` using the class notation.
2. **Rectangle #1**: Define a class `Rectangle` with a constructor that takes `width` and `height` as arguments.
3. **Rectangle #2**: Enhance the `Rectangle` class by handling cases where `width` or `height` is invalid.
4. **Rectangle #3**: Add an instance method `print()` to the `Rectangle` class to print the rectangle using the character 'X'.
5. **Rectangle #4**: Add instance methods `rotate()` and `double()` to the `Rectangle` class to modify its dimensions.
6. **Square #0**: Define a class `Square` that inherits from the `Rectangle` class and handles square dimensions.
7. **Square #1**: Enhance the `Square` class with an instance method `charPrint(c)` to print the square using a specific character.
8. **Occurrences**: Implement a function `nbOccurences(list, searchElement)` that returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list.
9. **Esrever**: Implement a function `esrever(list)` that reverses the elements of a list.
10. **Number Conversion**: Implement a function `converter(base)` that converts a number from base 10 to the specified base.
11. **Factor Index**: Compute a new array where each value is equal to the value of the initial list, multiplied by its index.
12. **Sorted Occurrences**: Compute a dictionary of user ids by occurrence, based on a given dictionary of occurrences by user id.
13. **Concat Files**: Concatenate the content of two source files into a destination file.

## How to Run

To run any of the scripts, navigate to the task directory and execute the corresponding main script using Node.js:

```sh
$ cd 0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures
$ node 0-main.js
```

Remember to modify the main scripts as needed to test different cases and functionalities.
