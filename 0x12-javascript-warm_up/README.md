## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language widely used for both scripting and web development. In this project, you will focus on the fundamentals of JavaScript programming to gain a strong foundation before diving into more advanced topics. The skills you acquire here will be crucial as you progress towards making dynamic web applications using JavaScript and libraries like JQuery.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the significance of JavaScript programming.
- Execute JavaScript scripts.
- Create and use variables and constants.
- Differentiate between `var`, `const`, and `let`.
- Utilize various data types available in JavaScript.
- Implement conditional statements using `if` and `if...else`.
- Utilize comments for code documentation.
- Assign values to variables.
- Employ loops like `while` and `for`.
- Use `break` and `continue` statements within loops.
- Define functions and understand their purpose.
- Understand variable scope.
- Perform arithmetic operations using operators.
- Manipulate dictionaries and objects.
- Import files in JavaScript.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project directory, is mandatory.
- Your code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x). Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

### More Info

#### Install Node 14

```sh
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Install semi-standard

```sh
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Tasks

### 0. First constant, first print

Write a script that prints "JavaScript is amazing":

- You must create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value "JavaScript is amazing".
- You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

**Example:**

```sh
$ ./0-javascript_is_amazing.js
JavaScript is amazing
```

### 1. 3 languages

Write a script that prints three lines:

- The first line: "C is fun"
- The second line: "Python is cool"
- The third line: "JavaScript is amazing"
- Use `console.log(...)` to print all output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

**Example:**

```sh
$ ./1-multi_languages.js
C is fun
Python is cool
JavaScript is amazing
```
